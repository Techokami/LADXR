Is the Wind Fish dreaming that he's sleeping in an egg?  Or is he dreaming that he's you?
Save Koholint.  By destroying it.  Huh?  Don't ask me, I'm just a kid!
There aren't enough women in this village to sustain a civilization.

The thumbs-up sign had been used by the Galactic Federation for ages. Me, I was known for giving the thumbs-down during briefing. I had my reasons, though...

You guys are spending more time adding Marin quotes than actually playing the game.
NASA faked the moon.
Doh, I missed!
Beginning the seed in... 100\n99\n98\n97\n96\n...\nJust Kidding.
Consider libre software!
Consider a GNU<stick>Linux installation!
Now you're gonna tell me about how you need to get some instruments or maybe shells to hatch a whale out of an egg, right?  All you boys are the same...

Have you considered multi-classing as a THIEF?
Don't call me Shirley
WHY are you buying CLOTHES at the SOUP STORE?
Believe it or not, this won't be the last time Link gets stranded on an island.

Did Matty give you this seed?  Yeesh, good luck.
Yoooo I looked ahead into the spoiler log for this one...\n...\n...\n...good luck.
Lemme check the spoiler log...\nOkay, cool, only the normal amount of stupid.
Oh, you're alive.  Dang.  Guess I won't be needing THIS anymore.
Now you're gonna go talk to my dad.  Gosh, boys are so predictable.
Shoot, I WAS going to steal your kidneys while you were asleep.  Guess I'll have to find a moment when you don't expect me.
You caught me, mid-suavamente!
You'll be the bedwetting champion in no time.
Link, stop doing that, this is the fifth time this week I've had to change the sheets!
You mind napping in Not My Bed next time?
Why do they call it oven when you of in the cold food of out hot eat the food?
Marin sayings will never be generated by AI.  Our community really is just that unfunny.

Ladies and gentlemen?  We got him.
Ladies and gentlemen?  We got her.
Ladies and gentlemen?  We got 'em.
What a wake up!  I thought you'd never Marin!  You were feeling a bit woozy and Zelda... What? Koholint?  No, my name's relief!  You must still be tossing.  You are on turning Island!
...Zelda?  Oh Marin is it?  My apologies, thank you for saving me.  So I'm on Koholint Island?  Wait, where's my sword and shield?!
Koholint?  More like kOWOlint.
What? The Wind Fish will grant my wish literally?  I forsee nothing wrong happening with this.
Hey Marin!  You woke me up from a fine nap!  ... Thanks a lot!  But now, I'll get my revenge!  Are you ready?!
Why bother coming up with a funny quote?  You're just gonna mash through it anyway.
something something whale something something dream something something adventure.
Some people won't be able to see this message!
If you're playing Archipelago and see this message, say hi to zig for me!
I think it may be time to stop playing LADXR seeds.
Rings do nothing unless worn!
Thank you Link, but our Instruments are in another Dungeon.
Are you sure you loaded the right seed?
Is this even randomized?
This seed brought to you by... Corners!
To this day I still don't know if we inconvenienced the Mad Batter or not.

She needs correction. Plap plap plap plap.
I told her "Matty no", but then she was like "Matty yes" and jumped off the wall.
I run ST<stick>WW btw.
YOU asked whether it was anatomically correct!
Zelda? It's Hylian-likely she'll be in this game.
Hello, you must be Zelda right? Oh, #####? My bad, the title screen confused me.
Never punished.
Welcome to my trap-eeer, ceremony.

It's a secret to everbody. Have I said that one yet?
Is Wordle still a thing?
Hey, let me tell you about Homestuck...
Ganondorf only wanted equality for his people.
Ganon is the pig. Ganondorf is the man.
So I walked in, and he was mid suavamente.
Why does everyone use 'he' for the Windfish? Did anyone ask? 
You now got Saria's song stuck in your ear.
Oh what I'd do if I didn't have you.
Mamma mia, here we go again.
When the moon hits you eye, like a big pizza pie, that's a moray. When an eel lunges out, and he takes a bite of your snout, that's a moray! ...Tarin, quit embarassing yourself!
Where in the timeline does this place again?
Dear!\n...Umm...\n...ahh...\nWhen I grow up,\nI'm going to be\nyour bride!\nAhh! I said it!
Link's Awakening\nIN COLOR
Crazy Tracy was being investigated for inappropriate behavior bordering assault.  Authorities have recently rescinded the investigation, however, when Link reportedly walked through a flamethrower.
Did you just hide the German Game Guide under the matress?
Tell me, #####, do you feel that only one person, someone not native to the island as well, should be making the decisions for the rest of the population?
Mr. Link, I don't feel so good...
It's dangerous to go alone. Take me along later
You expected Zelda. But it was me - Marin!
So I'm planning to climb the mountain later and tell him monsters- Oh! You're awake!
Vanilla? In my Koholint?
... Oh great, now you're woke.
You might find 'vanille' items - that's french vanilla, you know
I've been tasked with Facade's performance review before the next game comes out. They're thinking of demoting him.\nOn the other hand, Smasher and him are the only ones doing good enough to show up again.
Boy, it sure is a good day to be above the grass!
So, I turned the RTX on and Moldorm turned into a cheeseburger.
Marin is typing...
I feel like Moldorm should come in a vegetarian variant...  Like, Vegdorm
Help me, Link. You're my only hope! Wait, sorry, wrong franchise.
I reversed the polarity of the neutron flow.
We're all stories in the end. Just make it a good one, eh?
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?
Ich Liebe dich! Oh... it's German for I Love you! Giggle
Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I didn't think my cooking was that bad.
We tried to warn you about the emu

Say hi to Richard for me.
Is that a banana in your inventory or are you just glad to see us?
Link, get up! There's a life out there to enjoy, so enjoy it!
Man, what a great life. I'm so glad I haven't faded to dust or turned into a seagull.
Wake the Wind Fish. Fastest time wins. Your time starts when you selected a file.
All the information is on the task.
Welcome to Taskmaster. Your task is to collect as many instruments as possible with the time limit. Your time begins now.
You time started 8 seconds ago.
Happy Birthday!
Get back to work.
I've heard that if you enter BowWow's Doghouse from behind, something weird might happen. Don't ask me, I'm just a Marin.
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.
Rent is 200 rupees per day, toilet usage not included.
Get out there and make me some money!
Have you considered some of the many romhacks available for LADX?
Archipelago has advised us not to include piracy references in these.
I've heard Koholint is actually part of an Archipelago.
Great. I come to an island for my vacation and end up nursing some weirdo from the beach back to health. Oh! You're up!
There was a better joke here, but Daid said no.
We should probably curate these a bit better, but hey it makes every seed a fun surprise!
What is Koholint but a miserable little pile of rocks? And people? And animals? And monsters? Gosh it's actually a lot!
I'm just glad warlink decided to help out adding more of these quotes.
And this! ... Is to go even further beYOND SUPER NINTENDO!
This is an Nintendo that has ascended beyond a Super Nintendo.
Just as Miyamoto intended. N-intend-o'ed.
So this guy Wart said my dad looked like some "Mario" guy. Changed his name to Mamu and hid in the maze outside of town.
This game proves that Zelda, Kirby and Mario are actually the same universe. But hey, that's just a theory.
Do Nintendo characters all dream in the same universe?
Join me, and together we can rule this island as hero and gull!
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Dethl The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Owl would tell you. It's a Nightmare legend.
This is no island, it's a space station.
This is a dream. Nothing matters. Go nuts, kid.

I must say #####, The two pieces of pottery which were hand crafted by my father, Mari- er I mean Tarin, that are in the lower left corner of the inside of this house at tile positions, X6, Y1 and X6,Y2 do appear to be quite heavy...\nIf one were to attempt to lift them off of the ground, I do believe they could not achieve this goal only using their bare hands.
Is Bombs an Instrument?
No, Bombs are not an instrument.
Bombs are the best instrument.
You can't just play once a month and expect to get good.

Matty forgot to submit more text in the last round. We will now shame her forever.
We've been thinking about renovating. A house for Dampé, more teleporters, and a deal with Manbo for easy travel around the island.
Did you hear about the island redevlopment plan?  Yeah, it's set to make our local photography studio owner go homeless!
I'm not the only one who's seen the giant mouse with a camera, right?
Fifty shells!? That's way too many. There's like, twenty here, tops. Maybe twenty-six.
Apparently, the Wind Fish can dream in 3D now. What's a 3D?
We're thinking of adding a bunch more Heart Pieces too. Maybe about enough for you to have 20 Hearts?
The Trendy Game is being completely redone. You won't be able to cheese it anymore...
New World of Color... What's a Colo- oh wait, I was reading from a text list for the monochrome version, My bad.
When I found You on the beach, I noticed something hovering above the Egg on Mt. Tamaranch. I think it said something about a legend?
If you're going to the beach, watch out for any owls. They're notorious time wasters.
The Trendy Game's gonna have this brand new physics engine that'll be super cool and accurate and not absolutely rage inducing frustration at all.
Dad says it's my turn on the bed.
Alright, make room. It's chilly in here.
What? The Harp of Ages? I'm keeping that.

Link 2: The Past
This is Zelda 4. Well, considering DX is a re-release 4.5. It was supposed to be a version of 3. Which would have been like 2.8. But still - no Zelda in it.
If you're ever stuck, just do what I would do: throw a pot.
If you get stuck in Turtle Rock, try bombing a wall in a dark room.\n...Seriously, what's up with that?
AHHHAHAHAHAHA!! FOOOOOOOOOOL!! You blew it! You totally screwed yourself! Nobody enters my home and leaves in one piece!
AHHHAHAHAHAHA!! FOOOOOOOOOO- oh wait, it's you? I was kind of expecting a new victim to step in my traps. I've already taken your soul and everything.

There ain't no island, you're gonna get trolled
Someone told me you can't find Koholint Island on a map. That can't be true, can it?
I'd like to join your posse boys, but first I'm gonna sing a little song. It's called "Ballad of the Wind Fish".
Alright, I'm gonna sing, you back me up on your intsrum- Why are you pulling out a bomb?

You have no idea how many terrible ideas were left on the table to get this Marin message to you.
Always remember your secondary mission: destroy, dismantle, engulf in flames.
Rip and tear until it is done.
You should really partake in the LADXR tradition of Caturday.
So then, he tells me he has no idea what any of that means, he's just a kid...
Oh, sorry Zelda, I've gotta go. He just woke up. Ahem, welcome to Koholint-
Alright, you're all patched up. Would you like a Spongebob band aid or a Marvel Avengers band aid?
What's going to happen when we graduate?
What? Marin? No, my name's Zelda! You- Darn it, I did it again! CUT!
Apparently Tarin and I run a ranch in Ocarina of Time, or so the developers say.
